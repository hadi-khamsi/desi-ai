# Background Music

Place your Bollywood instrumental music files here (.mp3 or .wav format).

The system will randomly select a track to play softly in the background during voice responses.

## Where to get music:

1. **YouTube Audio Library** - Royalty-free music
   - Search for "Bollywood instrumental" or "Indian classical instrumental"

2. **Free Music Archive** - Creative Commons music
   - https://freemusicarchive.org

3. **Pixabay Music** - Free for commercial use
   - https://pixabay.com/music/

4. **Your own instrumentals** - Just drop them here!

## Tips:
- Use instrumental tracks (no vocals) for best effect
- Keep tracks under 3-5 minutes (they'll loop if needed)
- Name them descriptively: `bollywood_emotional.mp3`, `indian_classical.mp3`
